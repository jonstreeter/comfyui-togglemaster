## Usage

1. Add **Wireless Master Toggle** node (found in `utils` category)
2. Right-click the node → **Properties Panel**
3. Set your filter criteria:
   - `matchTitle`: Regex pattern (e.g., `^Char.*` for nodes starting with "Char")
   - `matchColors`: Comma-separated colors (e.g., `red, #ff0000`)
4. Toggle matching nodes on/off using the generated toggle widgets
